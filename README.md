# MyAudio
MyAudio is a cross platform mobile app that provides users with the opportunity to manage their audio files within playlists. 
Grouping audio files together into playlists allows users to listen to their desired list of audio files together, one after the other. 

When the app first loads, the user will be prompted to log in, or create an account if needed. Once logged in, they can access their audio
files and playlists with the ability to listen to them. New playlists can be created by selecting which audio files to add to the new playlist.
Existing playlists can be updated by adding or removing audio files.

### Sensors
Users can capture images using their mobile device's camera and use the image as a playlist image in the app.

### APIs
The app makes use of Firebase APIs for authentication (Firebase Authentication) and data storage (Firestore, Cloud Storage).
